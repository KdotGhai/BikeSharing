# Bikesharing
## Project Overview
Tableau is a powerful data analytical tool that provides easy to understand dashboards for non-technical and technical viewers alike. Tableau visualizations provide analysts a way to tell a clear story and easily share that story with others. 

This project will use a dataset on cityBike in New York City that will help create a business proposal for a potential bike sharing company.

### Checkout Times for Users
Nearly all bikes are checked out for less than an hour at a time, with most rides lasting about 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
A majority of bikes are checked out by male riders.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
Rides tend to increase during weekday commuting hours (6am-9am and 4pm-7pm), and midday during weekends.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Male and female riders share similar trends when checking out bikes based on day/time. Unknown may not have enough data to identify trends.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
Male subscribers represent the greatest rider demographic regardless of the day of the week.

## Summary
Viewing the above visualizations, we find: 
* A majority of users are male and that most of the riders are annual subscribers
* Peak riding hours are typically during workweek commuting hours and midday during the weekends when riders are more likely to be riding for leisure. 
* Though the map will look different for Des Moines, we can see from the map of starting locations, that most bikes are checked out in more highly populated areas like downtown or near tourist attractions.

Based on these findings, the bike app for Des Moines should:
* Focus on marketing to male riders and offering incentives for subscription. 
* We can also reccomend placing more bikes and docking stations near downtown areas, office buildings, and tourist attractions since CitiBike in New York appears to be used primarily for commuting and/or sightseeing.

Recommended Additional Visualizations: 
* A comparison of the number of trips bewteen different months to understand how ridership changes seasonally.
* Trips by weekday by age group
